# LCSChase
Implementing a basic Learning Classifier System to make an enemy follow a player, visualising in pygame

## TODO
~~1. implement matchset and action set~~
~~2. implement covering~~
~~3. implement basic fitness function~~
~~4. implement basic deletion~~
5. implement GA
6. implement subsumption
7. refine fitness function
8. refine deletion mechanism

## Status
Game runs, player can move.

Current behaviour:  Enemy successfully learns to follow player
                    Learning is slow and rules are not versatile
